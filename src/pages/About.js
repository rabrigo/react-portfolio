            I am a creative person that enjoys making music, dancing, performing, and making videos. After working as a technician, I decided to follow through with an idea prompted by the pandemic: pursue a career path in tech. There were several factors informing this. At the time, I was living just 30 minutes away from Silicon Valley, several of my friends worked in tech, and having asthma made work remote ideal.

            My skills informed this as well. All of my work experience involved computer use. I studied J# in high school through AP Computer Science and dabbled in 2d game engines. At my most recent job, I was already practicing behaviors crucial to working in tech. I was practicing analytical thinking, troubleshooting hardware and software, collaborating across different teams, and adopting a solution driven mindset.
