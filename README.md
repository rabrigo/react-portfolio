## Description
A straight forward portfolio page implenting React to render the front end. This page consists of a header and navigation element. The page does not change but the navigation will render a different component depending on which link is clicked, as seen in the gif up top. 

## Built With
React.js was used to make the front end responsive. React Router facilitated linked the header links to the components. This page was successfully deployed on GitHub thanks to https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages

## Installation

## Usage

Do not attempt to visit those routes as URL's, they are not links.

## Future Updates
